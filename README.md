#Memory Game Project

##How to Play

The game board consists of cards arranged in a grid. The deck is made of different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down. Flip over cards one at a time until a match is found.

The game ends when all matches have been found.
